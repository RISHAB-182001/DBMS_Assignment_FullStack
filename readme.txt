In this Project, we were supposed to display the SQL database that we had created using postgres on the frontend of our website, when the user types in a select statement for obtaining a particular table in a database.
I(Rishab Kashyap BS) was responsible for creating both the frontend and backend in this Project.
For the frontend, I used html, css and javascript.
Whereas for backend, I used node, express and postgres.
I linked node to the postgres database to obtain the tables from it and read it in the json format and then converted the output to String and displayed it on the Frontend.

Though, it was a single page application I think I will prefer using React from the next time, since I'll have the option of choosing between numerous libraries present there and the ease of integrating the backend with react.

The different files and its contents are:
reg.html=> Registration page
home.html=> Home Page
style.css=> Styling for home Page

We have used internal css styling in reg.html whereas we have 
linked an external stylesheet to home.html 

I will have provided the create and insert commands for my sql database to run this model.
Thank you!
